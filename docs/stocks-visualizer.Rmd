## Stock Visualizer Application

The "Stock Visualizer" application looks up stock prices by ticker symbol and displays the result as a line chart.

## How to use it?

- **"Symbol" textbox:** Type a stock to examine (required).
- **"Date Range" calendars:** Defines the dates which we're interested in (required).
- **Plot y axis on log scale checkbox:** Plot stock prices on the y axis.
- **Adjust prices for inflation checkbox:** Adjusts prices for inflation.

## Core server calculation

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.height=3, fig.width=5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(quantmod); source("../helpers.R")
  dataInput <- getSymbols('SPY', src = "yahoo", from = '2013-01-01',
               to = '2015-12-31', auto.assign = FALSE)
    chartSeries(dataInput, theme = chartTheme("white")
                , type = "line", log.scale = FALSE, TA = NULL)
```




## Information source
By default, "Stock Visualizer" displays the SPY ticker (an index of the entire S & P 500). To look up a different stock, type in a stock symbol that Yahoo finance will recognize. You can look up Yahoo's stock symbols [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/lookup). Some common symbols are GOOG (Google), AAPL (Apple), and GS (Goldman Sachs).
